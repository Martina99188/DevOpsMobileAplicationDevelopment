350,"profile: remove redundant code in DiveCalculatedCeiling
 
 The DiveCalculatedCeiling profile-item has a recalc()
 function, which calls ""dataModel->calculateDecompression()"".
 This is a questionable reversal of control-flow: The
 profile-item should paint the model-data not change it.
 
 The code was supposed to be called under two conditions:
 
 1) The value of the calcceiling3m preferences flag changed.
  This code was buggy for two reasons: Firstly, the cached
  value was always initialized to false, which means that
  sometimes the first call was missed. Secondly, the
  settingsChanged() functions was only called when closing
  the preferences window, not when changing the flag in the
  profile widgets.
 
 2) The datetime of the dive changed. The whole control-flow is
  pretty absurd (due to ""bit rot""):
  - The replan-dive command sends a date-time changed signal.
  - The main tab changes the date-time and informs the profile.
  - The profile sends a signal to the item.
  - The item instructs the model to recalculate the
  decompression.
  - The model causes the profile to be redrawn.
 
 In any case, the whole thing is moot, because the decompression
 is recalculated for *every* profile plot in create_plot_info_new().
 
 Let's remove the code from the DiveCalculatedCeiling profile-item
 and the calculateDecompression() function, which is now not
 used anymore.

469,"Undo: implement undo of dive site editing
 
 This one is a bit more tricky. There are two modes: set dive site
 and set newly created dive site. This is realized using an OO model
 with derived classed. Quite convoluted - but it seems to work.
 
 Moreover, editing a dive site is not simply setting a value,
 but the list of dives in a dive site has to be kept up to date.
 
 Finally, we have to inform the dive site list of the changed
 number of dives. Therefore add a new signal diveSiteDivesChanged.
 To send only one signal per dive site, hook into the undo() and
 redo() functions and call the functions of the base class there.

 # Why
 
 
 
 Fixes #3935 
 
 
 
 # How
 
 
 
 After setting `tint` or `intensity` properties, we haven't been applying new style to the blur view. Calling `didSetProps` fixed the problem. 
 
 
 
 # Test Plan
 
 
 
 Tested with a simple bare RN app:
 
 ```jsx
 
 import React, { Component } from 'react';
 
 import { Image, StyleSheet, Text, View } from 'react-native';
 
 import { BlurView } from 'expo-blur';
 
 
 
 const uri = 'https://s3.amazonaws.com/exp-icon-assets/ExpoEmptyManifest_192.png';
 
 
 
 export default class BlurViewExample extends React.Component {
 
  render() {
 
  return (
 
  <View style={{ flex: 1, marginTop: 45 }}>
 
  <Image style={{ width: 192, height: 192 }} source={{ uri }} />
 
 
 
  {/* Adjust the tint and intensity */}
 
 
 
  <BlurView tint=""light"" intensity={80} style={StyleSheet.absoluteFill}>
 
  <Image style={{ width: 96, height: 96 }} source={{ uri }} />
 
  </BlurView>
 
 
 
  </View>
 
  );
 
  }
 
 }
 
 ```

707,"Fixed handling of Image/Info URL files. The files
 image_url.dat and info_url.dat contain data for web
 links attached to the popup menus of various objects.
 
 The first time KStars is run, the globally-installed
 files are copied into the user's KDEHOME directory,
 so they are free to add/modify/remove links as they
 see fit. However, this means that if the global
 version of the file is updated, the user will not
 see the updates, because KStars only looks at the
 global file if the local file does not exist.
 
 This is now fixed. KStarsData::openURLFile()
 compares the timestamps of the global and local
 versions. If the global version is newer, then
 it is checked for new or duplicate lines. When
 checking lines, only the object-name and text-label
 fields are considered, not the URL itself. This
 is done so that if a link's URL is updated, it is
 still considered a duplicate of the original line.
 New lines in the global file are appended to the
 local file. When duplicate lines are found, the
 line from the global file replaces the line in the
 local file.
 
 Please test this on your system using the recently
 updated image_url.dat. Before running
 kstars, your local image_url.dat should have ~440
 lines. Afterwards, it should have ~650 lines.

774,"fs/gui: fix makeUUID (#20593)
 
 * fs/gui: fix makeUUID
 
 
 
 Crazy bug. SimpleFS expects a string opID and interpret it as [16]byte.
 
 We use a UUID library and call `uuidv1`, which despite being timestamp
 
 based, would happily go over 16 bytes even though we supply with a
 
 Buffer.alloc(16). After cutting off, we occasionally get duplicasted
 
 opID. Possibly due to the way uuidv1 is formatted, this happens pretty
 
 often.
 
 
 
 It's a problem when we have multiple RPCs going on. Visible issue
 
 isone can get another's opID removed from inProgress when SimpleFSWait
 
 is called. This is why occasionally draging/dropping many files results
 
 in error on some but not all files.
 
 
 
 It's also why sometimes error happens after creating a new folder in
 
 GUI, which is what this ticket was originally about. We do a
 
 folderListLoad after creating succeeds because historically we didn't
 
 have notifications when folder content changed and we just reloaded
 
 everytime we changed something. Now that we have notifications,
 
 notifications cause such loads too. So multiple folerListLoad can happen
 
 concurrently and when unforutnate duplicaste opID happen. It's more
 
 likely to happen when multiple folder creations happen together.
 
 Apparently we should avoid loading after successfully creating a folder
 
 now that we have notifications, but that's a separate issue which I'll
 
 have another PR.

I also noticed that in the new FOV dialog, the word ""length"" appreaed as ""lengt"" only, I thought first it was a type but when I opened the ui file, it wasn't a type but rather a layout issue. Since different users have different font and resolution settings, it's better to encapsulate all widgets in layouts.
 
 The new ui can grow/shrink in size without problem in Qt designer. However, because FOVDialog is a child of KDialogBase, the shrinking of the FOV ui is not as pretty. This shrinking problem exists with the old ui as well.
 
 The FOV feature is great Jason! When I created a new FOV and then switched to it from the menu, I sort of expected KStars to zoom to the new FOV for the current focus in the skymap (or center). The zoom should be a little larger than the FOV symbol itself so the user can see the symbol. If a user switches to very small FOV (like that of HST), they don't know the change because the symbol is tiny, so maybe the autozoom when switching FOVs would resolve that issue as well.

 Android's base64 decoder rejects ""some"" bad inputs, but not all of them.
 This means that if a VPN profile had stored a literal certificate instead
 of a base64-encoded certificate (as was the case in <= 0.7), it might get
 decoded into junk data. Through experimentation and reading the source
 code, it was shown that inputs like ""a&bc"" or ""ab*c"" do not raise
 exceptions.
 
 So we will add a regexp to reject any base64 string with invalid
 characters. At the minimum this should cause PEM files starting with
 ""-----BEGIN "" to be processed as literal values, not as base64.

 The FragmentTransaction API is a little confusing. When the addToBackStack

 not any subsequent transactions that aren't added to the back stack.

 I haven't created an issue first, since I thought it would be better to go straight to a pull request, since that illustrates much better what I think you (we?) should change. I hope this is okay.
 
 
 
 This is about updating the `tsconfig.json` file and the associated documentation because I think there are some - minor - improvement and clarifications that can be made. This is mostly smaller misunderstandings that I actually usually see i `tsconfig` files.
 
 
 
 # How
 
 
 
 Update the `tsconfig.json` file and the documentation associated with it.

 We're going to switch the data structure we use for this to something
 that's efficient to keep updated (#4438). The new one will be just
 as well suited for code that consumes this data structure as the old
 -- in fact better for some of them -- so we'll have the consumers
 switch to using the new data structure, too. That means the selector
 that provides the old data structure is going away.
 
 As a first step, we rename the old selector to a ""legacy"" name,
 making room for a selector providing the new data structure to
 take its name. , https://github.com/zulip/zulip-mobile",CODE

 The in_planner() function is incompatible with a reentrant
 profile, since it accesses a global variable. In
 create_plot_info_new() it is essentially redundant, because
 there is a planner_ds (ds = deco_state) parameter that
 is used only when in the planner. Therefore use that as
 the in_planner indicator: when non-null, the profile is
 showing a planned dive.

 pass, when they were handled in the first pass).
 Removed some command line options for which there
 is a guy (e.g. --weather), or which are not really
 useful (--list-karts). 
 
 All parameters to options must now consistently be
 specified using '=', e.g.: --log=1 and --kart=tux.
 
 Also removed support for 'classic' camera (which was
 not used anymore). Removed now unneccessary #include
 in user_config.hpp, which made some #include changes
 in other files necessary.

 Summary:
 Depending on the refresh period of an INDI weather driver it could take a while until the first data point is received. Until this happens, the list of sensors remains empty.
 To avoid this, an immediate refresh is called when the display is initialized.
 
 Additionally, some UI optimizations have been added:
 - Splitter between dome and weather display added
 - When only one data point is available in the history, a dot is displayed
 
 Test Plan: Use the openweathermap INDI driver and observe, that with this fix the sensor data is immediately present

 # How
 
 
 
 - exported mocked `RCTDevLoadingViewProtocol` module for `dev-menu` and `dev-client` (otherwise, messages from those modules might override messages from the app.
 
 - made `dev-menu` loads after the app - default `RCTDevLoadingView` implementation is listening on `RCTJavaScriptDidLoadNotification` - if we tried to load two apps simultaneously, the loading view will be hidden when the one app will be loaded.
 
 - removed from `dev-menu` and `dev-client` ability to reload.

 There are a few interesting issues with this:
 
 - this requires a change to the SDA file format; thankfully I control that
  format, too (the default files are not valid XML files)
 - once again, the fact that adding samples can change the dive pointer
  messes with me - I decided to change the interface of ALL of the
  XXX_dive_match functions to take a struct dive**
  I know this is not ideal as all the other functions don't need that -
  but I would have hated the inconsistency
 - there is the issue that we now overload two _different_ uemis formats in
  the same function - that's certainly a potential point of confusion
 - a minor detail is the problem that the SDA format is kinda odd to parse
  and that we trigger on the duration field by it being the only float.
  Yeah, that's not ideal - but again, I control the format, so I _know_
  this is true.
